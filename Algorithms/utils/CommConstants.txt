/**
 * xxxy
 * <p>
 * x is the distance (in cm) or angle (in degrees),whether it’s distance or angle is depending on the direction
 * <p>
 * And y is the direction of motion
 * <p>
 * Values of y with their corresponding motions are:
 * 0, forwards
 * 1, backwards
 * 2, forward left
 * 3, forward right
 * 4, backwards left
 * 5, backwards right
 * 6, some special algo to position the robot to the next face of the obstacle // i think this was handled
 * // by their stm?
 * 7, stop movement for time specified by rpi // i suspect might be handled by their rpi?
 * 8, reset front wheels (note that effectiveness of resetting wheels might depend on the ground type that the robot
 * is on, I haven’t had the chance to test it out extensively yet though) // suspect that this might be handled by
 * // their stm
 * <p>
 * Eg. 1000 is equal to 100 cm forwards
 * 1002 is equal to 100 degrees forward left
 * And special case 1007 is stop movement for 1 second (to get 1 second take the 100 before the direction number and
 * multiply by 10 to get 1000ms, yes it’s calculated in milliseconds so that is equal to 1 second)
